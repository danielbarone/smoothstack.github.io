## Problems They Addressed

1. It is becoming ever more difficult to have health plans reimburse claims for lab tests in a reliable and consistent manner.
1. Many lab companies report that they are experiencing high rates of denied claims.
1. When the claim is finally paid by the insurer in 60 days or longer, the lab must then send a bill to the patient to collect the required deductible. When this happens, the clinical laboratory has two unhappy customers: the patient and the patientâ€™s physician!

## The Solution
