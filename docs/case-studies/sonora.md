## Key Takeaways

- SQL previously spent an enormous amount
of time collating reports and performing
manual calculations.
- The organization reduced the labor necessary to
pull their daily performance report from 5 hours a
day to just 45 minutes a day
- By reducing manual work and duplicate work,
overall employee efficiency increased by 85%

## The Challenge

Sonora Quest Laboratories (SQL), a joint venture between
Banner Health and Quest Diagnostics, is the nationâ€™s
largest integrated laboratory system, serving more than
20,000 patients every day. Like many laboratories, SQL
struggled with endless silos of data and information.
This required stakeholders in various departments to
manually enter data across multiple systems while IT
resources retrieved, analyzed, and distributed reports.
Yet IT resources became strained as the organization
transitioned from a client-centric LIS to patient-centric
LIS, further exacerbating the burden of manually collating
performance reports and key quality metrics.

## The Solution

SQL leadership realized that in order to move forward
with strategic initiatives, the organization needed a
solution that provided real-time end-user reports and
dashboards and visibility of these reports across the
entire organization. SQL ingested multiple data sources
into their healthcare-specific CRM to automatically create
detailed, real-time dashboards that indicate up-to-the
moment trends and performance against key metrics. 

Additionally, it is extremely important that SQL leaders
understand how staffing and volume intersect in order
to ensure they are properly staffed for the types of tests
performed. Graphs and visual charts allow users to track
if they are meeting TAT benchmarks, if their volume
is level-loaded, and track by the hour how many tests
are coming in and how many are completed. SQL is
now able to instantly assess bandwidth by test and
by department to ensure they are staffing the correct
departments at the correct times and at the correct
levels. Leaders can also identify if certain departments
are struggling with staffing or missing their benchmarks.

## The Results

The overall visibility achieved by SQL has reduced the
labor necessary to pull their daily performance report
from 5 hours a day to just 45 minutes a day, increasing
overall employee efficiency by 85%.

SQL is now able to:
- Provide real-time financial and operational trend
analysis to key stakeholders
- Use live dashboards and reports to review and
manage TaT, utilization, reimbursements, volume,
and productivity
- Track employee productivity across departments
to drive accountability
- Broadcast reports and immediately notify key stakeholders of any risks, missed benchmarks, or red flags

SQL now has a real-time, 360-degree view of data and
metrics across departments, effectively dissolving data
silos and providing users with the information necessary to
provide a 5-star experience to patients and clients alike.
