## Competition

There are a total of 7 blood drawing laboratories in Fargo. 

The Closest competitor is Mednet, located four miles away. This is the facility that 95% of the physicians in the Main Street Professional Building currently use.

## Sales Strategy

### Most forms of insurance accepted
{: .no_toc .mb-1 .text-green-300 }

This is important because the vast number of patients that will have their blood tested will not be self-paying.
{: .mb-5 .fw-300 }

### Quick turn-around
{: .no_toc .mb-1 .text-green-300 }

A doctor's diagnosis and treatment is often based on the results of the test.
{: .mb-5 .fw-300 }

### Convenience
{: .no_toc .mb-1 .text-green-300 }

There is no other alternative that is more convenient than sending the patients to an office within the building.

## Marketing Strategy

Fargo Medical Laboratories will undertake a marketing strategy employing three means of communicating its new service offering:
{: .fw-300 }

1. **Direct mail:** Local physicians will receive a flyer announcing the opening of Fargo Medical Laboratories and detailing the services offered. A list of physicians is easily obtained through the local licensing board.
1. **Personal introductions:** to Main Street Professional Building tenants. A representative from Fargo Medical Laboratories will visit all of the medical offices within the building as a way of introducing FML to the doctors. This will provide FML with an opportunity to develop a personal relationship with doctors, something that is useful and valuable for service providers within a licensed industry.
1. **Advertisements:** Ads will be placed in the regional flyer that all licensed physicians receive as members of their local chapter of the American Medical Association (AMA).

## Personnel Plan

- Lab manager will handle business development, sales, marketing, accounting, courier, customer service, and assorted lab tech work.
- Two phlebotomists on staff at any one time to draw blood.
- One Lab technician will be responsible for doing onsite blood tests. This will be a part-time position. Lav manager will be able to fill in as needed in this capacity
